      <description>An axis-aligned bounding box, or AABB for short, is a box aligned with coordinate axes and fully enclosing
some object. Because the box is never rotated with respect to the axes, it can be defined by just its
::ref::center and ::ref::extents, or alternatively by ::ref::min and ::ref::max points.

/Bounds/ is used by [[Collider.bounds]], [[Mesh.bounds]] and [[Renderer.bounds]].</description>

        <summary>Sets the bounds to the /min/ and /max/ value of the box.</summary>
        <description>Using this function is faster than assigning /min/ and /max/ separately.</description>
